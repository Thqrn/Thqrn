# Notable Projects
### Quality Muncher
A program written to make media (videos, gifs, audio, images) look worse in almost every way imaginable. Interlacing, frying, downscaling/downscampling, heavy compression, text-to-speech, corruption, and plenty more. There's a [batch version](https://github.com/qm-org/qualitymuncher) (TUI), a [Go version](https://github.com/qm-org/qm-go) (CLI), and a [Python version](https://github.com/qm-org/qm-py) (CLI). All require FFmpeg.

### FFmpeg Scripts
A collection of almost all of the batch/FFmpeg scripts I often use, with many uses. Some notable ones include:
- a video to GIF converter
- a frame extractor (extracts a frame from a video and saves it)
- a video resampler (blends frames of the video together)
- WebM scaling (takes a video and creates a variable resolution WebM with it)
- properties (displays some traits I find important for media files, such as resolution, codecs, duration, and frame count)
- compare multiple (compares multiple video side-by-side, I've tested this with as many as 42 videos at the same time

*Requires Windows 10/11 and FFmpeg.*
