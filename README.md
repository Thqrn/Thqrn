# Who am I?
Hello, I'm Frost, but sometimes I go by Thqrn. I write batch scripts, most of them using FFmpeg.

### Quality Muncher
An extremely customizable batch script designed to make your videos, images, audios, and GIFs look worse, in almost any way you can imagine. There's interlacing, downscaling, downsampling, color correction, text, text to speech, deep frying, corruption, and more. For a full(er) list check the [features](https://qualitymuncher.lgbt/features) page.

### FFmpeg Scripts
A collection of almost all of the batch/FFmpeg scripts I often use, with many uses. Some notable ones include
- a video to GIF converter
- a frame extractor (extracts a frame from a video and saves it)
- a video resampler (blends frames of the video together)
- WebM scaling (takes a video and creates a variable resolution WebM with it)
- Properties (displays some traits I find important for media files, such as resolution, codecs, duration, and frame count)
- Compare multiple (compares multiple video side-by-side, I've tested this with as many as 42 videos at the same time)
*Requires Windows 10/11 and FFmpeg. No cross-platform version of these scripts exist as of now.*
